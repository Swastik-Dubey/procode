        <h1>About  C Programming</h1>
        <p>C language is inspired from B language which was developed by Ken Thompson.<br>
            C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating
            systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for
            beginners<br>


        </p>
        <h1>Why to learn c programming</h1>

        <p>C helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves
            information.
            After learning C, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.
            Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux kernel,
            Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C programming.</p>
        <h1>C features</h1>
        <p class="fs-5"><b> Portability</b></p>
        <p>C Language programs are portable that allows it to run on different operating systems. Because of the
            portability feature, programs written in C works on different computer systems with little or no
            modifications.</p>
        <p class="fs-5"><b>Pointers</b></p>
        <p> C provides efficient use of pointers. Using pointers, you can directly interact with the memory.
            As C Language collected all useful features of previous languages, it has become more efficient &
            user-friendly as compare to previous languages.</p>
        <p class="fs-5"><b>Speed</b></p>
        <p>C programs run faster. C is also called a middle-level language. Actually, it has advantages of both high
            level and middle-level languages.</p>
        <p class="fs-5"><b> Extendability</b></p>
        <p>Another feature of C is extendability. It is an ability to extend the existing software by adding some new
            features. </p>

        <h1>Basic Syntax</h1>


        <div id="comment">
            <h2>Hello World Program</h1>
            <p>&emsp; main(){ <br>
                &emsp; printf("Hello World!");<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;}</p>
        </div>

        <div id="comment">
            <h2>Multi-line comments ( // )</h1>
            <p>// this is Multi line comment</p>
        </div>

        <div id="comment">
            <h2>Multi-line comments ( /* */ )</h1>
            <p>/* this is Multi line comment */</p>
        </div>
     <p class="fs-2"><b>Loops</b></p>
        <p>At times, certain instructions require repeated execution. Loops are an ideal way to do the same. A loop
            represents a set of instructions that must be repeated.<br>
            In a loops context, a repetition is termed as an iteration.</p>

        <p class="fs-5"><b>The For loop</b></p>
        <p>The for loop is an implementation of a definite loop. The for loop executes the code block for a specified
            number of times.<br>
            It can be used to iterate over a fixed set of values, such as an array</p>
        <p class="fs-5"><b>While Loop</b></p>
        <p>The while loop executes the instructions each time the condition specified evaluates to true. <br>
            In other words, the loop evaluates the condition before the block of code is executed.</p>
        <p class="fs-5"><b>Do-While loop</b></p>
        <p>The do…while loop is similar to the while loop except that the do...while loop doesn’t evaluate the condition
            for the first time the loop executes.</p>

        <p class="fs-5"><b>Break Statement</b></p>
        <p>The break statement is used to take the control out of a construct. Using break in a loop causes the program
            to exit the loop.<br> Following is an example of the break statement.The Syntax used here is simply [break
            ;]</p>
